TimeRanks
=========

A PocketMine - MP plugin that lets you easily create configurable ranks for your server. Ranks are time-based, so TimeRanks is ideal to give players a rank based on their time spent online.
Each rank is linked to a PurePerms group, so you can give players different permissions depending on how much time they spent online.
